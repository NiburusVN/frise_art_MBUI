#	[Minecraft illustration with python code]



## Introduction :

During the highschool in 2022, i had to develop with 2 of my IT partners, an illustration of a game by using only python code, coordinates, geometry mathematics, recursivity logic, pixels and hexadecimal for colors. 
I was with my partner Amine Belhaj and Pheakdey Sop and we worked on this project for almost 2 weeks just for the pleasure to work together on an uncommon python project. 
So no deadline and no stress ! Only fun ! :)


## A little look of the illustration generated by python code:
